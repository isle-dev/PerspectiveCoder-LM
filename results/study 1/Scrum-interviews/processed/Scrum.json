I've seen projects were, like, healthcare projects where quality, absolutely zero chance of an error. And you might think, yeah, it's, let's do a test case and provide a hundred percent reliability, but it might not be that, for example, for Google search engine. They have so many computers that the CPU has a very, very small error rate, like, I don't know zero point zero zero zero one percent. But when you have millions of computers processing data, you already have to think about cross checking results. So, you might need the same calculations more than once or more than one PC. And cross check the results. So, this is good quality for them to provide reliable results, not just that your code is good, including the underlying hardware will provide good results. Until this day, NASA, in their mathematical CPUs, they need special hardware to ensure that very high precision, math will provide accurate results, not like oops, there was a zero zero one percent chance for an error and then crashed, you cannot afford this quality results from the project. Quality on long term projects might also mean that you are able to handover your part of the project to someone else in a clean manner. So, the code is commented, the code is beautiful, I would say, this might mean for them quality code. Because if they keep bringing on new programmers, and there's no quality code, after a while the project will crash from start from zero. Code quality might mean testing friendly code. So many cases you expect your code to behave in a certain manner. And why behave many situations. But for maybe even Google, if you want to provide a quality project, you are able, this is why I like functional programming. You can test every part, you have a very good code coverage for retesting, because you know you can test all the inputs for a simple function, and you have certain output ranges. Now if you are coding object oriented and your object can do absolutely everything. That is almost impossible to do code coverage and reliable testing. So might not be quality code for them.

So, we have the discussion set in place and then we're taking the actions, normally the team.

But for Scrum, what happens, even the inexperienced developer or QA or whoever it is that when we say development team, it consists of all those skills required to develop the product. So, everyone has a say. The team as a group, we are thinking how we can deliver the value and we are constantly checking with the customer about what we are building, \"are you okay with that?\" So that continuous inspection and adaption of change, that is what delivers value to the customer.

So yeah, that feedback is what makes the biggest difference in Agile compared to the Waterfall project. Inspection and the continuous adaption improves quality. And also, transparency. That is the important bit. We are really transparent in our meetings. As part of a Scrum master that is what I am doing. I provide all the data, make it transparent to the team.

So, if we have any doubt or query, that is answered at the very beginning rather than bringing up questions towards the end. That gives the team of the entire duration of the sprint, to work on something, rather than if it was the question was asked later on.

So, the team could incorporate that change and then the same iteration will follow, and then again, the same thing would be displayed to the customer during the meeting at the end of the other sprint.

Usually again this is something which people love to keep it under the carpet is that testers are usually having lower skill sets than a developer. So, what happens is, for example, if you're a tester and I'm a developer and I have developed something but if you don't have the knowledge of how to test it, you cannot challenge me back. And, if you can't challenge me back, you won't have a robust project. So, the tester is at the mercy of the developers saying, OK, you do it this way, it will pass. That is one of the challenges where we miss on creating a robust product because the testers skill set are not seriously looked upon as we look at a developer's skill set. That is a gap we need to bridge. When we mention testing in iterations, again all boils down to the tester's knowledge. If a tester is knowledgeable of the business requirements, he can participate in the product increment planning or this sprint planning saying that these bits can be developed. Let's divide the project into three iterations, A B and C. So, A can be tested after the first sprint. B can be tested after the second sprint and C can be tested after the third sprint.

So, it was more around transparency, everyone has got the entire team including the developers, the waterfall teams. Again, the problem is the structure. There is a developer, there is a tech lead, there is application lead, there is design team, this is not beneficial to the product.

But then, of course, when he starts developing it, he can always ask the peers to help or even sometimes some things are more complex, then that person requests a meeting and we all go into a room and we just brainstorm together for one hour. But in the refinements, there's always a touch point where we all talk about it and we kind of have an idea on how it will work best to get this new feature into what we have right now. And then personally, in my team, we have a lot of, I would say, probably a big project that's been going for five, six years, which means a lot of it code. So, for every new thing that we add, it has to be carefully thought of on how best to do it because some things are easier. In general, all of the features have to be carefully thought on how to implement this. When developers choose their own story to work on, they feel ownership and duty to deliver better work and its quality is far superior. This is from experience...\n\nI totally agree. I think it's good to empower developers without feeling fear from the consequences. And also, not only empower the people to change behavior and to voice their opinions. So, this I can also sidestep a bit here. This is also a bit what the scrum master has to do. Because some people will talk less, and some others will talk more. But in this setup, once again, it's nice to have a scrum master that can read the room and I think that person over there has a question that maybe he's not raising it right now. So, it's also good to have people that's has more of the agile mentality, to bring the voice out of people. So, I totally agree. It really brings people closer to what they are developing in the end. In the end, if you're just going to your workplace, not now because we work from home, but you just do your new features and then you turn it off and you really don't know the impact it has then after a while, I think it gets a bit boring.

And we'll have like five percent of the features that have some bugs. For our case, in my opinion, is totally acceptable because it brings us advantages like the speeds and developing things faster and having faster feedback from stakeholders. I think it overwrites the five percent of defects that we find over time. In Scrum, we have this frequent inspection by the business users; the feedback we get early on the process reduces bugs.

It might take like twenty hours of time to do the manual testing. At a result, the quality might be the same but there is always a chance you might miss a scenario or two so that's part of the regression manual testing. But the benefit of automation testing when you develop an automation tool, like if there's a code change, if there is a functionality change, you just go back to the script and just update those scripts only. All it takes it just instead of running twenty hours of manual testing effort, automation it takes like a couple of hours. You should be able to achieve the quality much quicker. And you can identify the defects in a timely manner. And you should be able to report to the development team and that gives them enough time in the sprint to fix the issues and get back to you. So that way, you can still re-execute the automation suite and then it’s good to go. So, that's one way to achieve higher quality.

That's part of the requirement and we developed it and tested it, and everything works as expected. As part of the sprint review, review meeting,  we went through the sprint session, the product owner came back and said, after we presented the demo, yes this page looks good but as part of the security measures, we don't like to display the whole characters or whole phone number to the user, so we should mask it with asterisks. \n\n\nBut this wasn't clearly defined as part of the product and even he didn't know because when he was given the requirements by the product manager, that's all he got.

So now I come, we sit down, and we discuss, and he's called Alvin. I said, Alvin, we need to talk about ABC, I'm thinking we should implement it like this. He asks me why should we implement it? Is it useful? We'll discuss, yes, because I think ABC, then now we implemented. So that's for the principles. For the tools, we use linters. So, like every product has, like, for example, front end tools, we have an ESLint and a Prettier file that is set by the software lead. So, when the software lead says, this is what this product can look like. So now, two spaces, arrows of the parentheses, everything that they feel is important, and we tend to use, instead of using our own predefined steps, we tend to use the global presets. Like personally, we prefer the Airbnb standard, like from JavaScript. So, when you declare an ESLint, you set up the file. Then you say everyone was working on this project, you have to, by default, the system substring, lots of errors, if you don't use the linting tools that are provided. And so that's one of the ways we use to keep quality. We use linters that are set for the whole project globally. So that even if you create a file in a file in a folder and a folder in a folder, the same rules apply. Actually, they've been the most efficient, especially when it comes to front end work. That's been a very efficient tool for us. Because before some people like two spaces in the HTML, some people like four.

So, I've been on boarded with many other projects, some that use Scrum, some that didn't, some I just do work, we'll pay you when we done. What I find, the truth is, if you do Scrum well enough, if you really implement it, and are very careful, and anyone is dedicated to it, the need for a project manager diminishes. Because what happens is, you already know exactly what you're supposed to do. You know when you're supposed to get it done, you know how it's supposed to be done. And you know, exactly by Friday, and to have finished this, it needs to work like this, this and this, the client is waiting for it because for the client, it means this and this and this. So, what Scrum does, is it gives you, instead of you as a developer having to focus on every single thing. And the problem with having every single thing in mind is that the quality drops, with Scrum you just have to think of this week, I have to do this. So, you can focus your attention. And when you focus your attention on that smaller subset of things you can do, the quality always goes up. That's something I can do. I can almost...it always goes up. Whenever you give the developers smaller bits of frequent work, the quality goes up, because the developer can focus on today, this table has to work. I will make this table work very well, as opposed to giving them a plethora of thirty things. In their thinking of because even when they're doing one thing, item one or thirty, they can't even take time to focus on it. Because they're thinking, I have to do to thirty-three, or thirty-four, or thirty-five, or forty. It makes the quality go up. And it gives the programmer less to juggle.\"",

They have to give us, it's not an option, the client has to give us a written document outlining all the user scenarios. So that when we are building, we are going back to this to this particular item and checking. The client says they wanted to be able to send reports within ten seconds, does it do that. So that's the fastest way that we can make sure on the externals. The second part is we meet with the client regularly, every three weeks, depending on the client. Some want it longer, some want it shorter, we meet. We show them this what we have so far. Let's have a discussion to see, the client goes to the system. Now this is between the project lead and the software lead. The developers are not, they can, we tend to invite them so we can see the process. And sometimes after some questions that we may not have the best answers and that's usually when it's why you did this. And the client, in those meetings, we are taking notes, anything that they say, I'm not liking this, this isn't what I asked for, or did you also add this, or I was thinking of a scenario where I conduct our business this might happen. So, during those conversations, we are taking notes and recording them so that when we go now for the next set of Scrums, we're making sure that the client was satisfied with what was already done, and what wasn't, we are implementing it as we go along.\"",

The form that was not okay, not the whole system, the form that was collecting that data it crashed. So, the developers like, oh, I haven't considered a situation where, yeah, so you have to consider that because the developer is thinking from a developer perspective, not really business. So, they were like, yeah, you have to consider some of the schools we'll go to won't have parents with registered phone, so now, go back and make sure that this code throws an error that looks like this when the school doesn't have any guardians. So, if we didn't do that meeting, you just let the developer, if you let them check themselves that yes, this worked, yes. Because from the perspective, it can send, it can send notifications if you just let them check themselves without that quality review. Without that, wait, let's test this thing, make sure it works completely, then roll it out, that would have gone to production, that was there.

Having that discussion, they keep it in mind. They don't have to really develop about it. But there's a way of framing everything in mind, makes them more feature minded. This helps the scalability of the system and future requirements. And there's the second part is because its informal, developers feel easy. So, they can suggest, they feel they can suggest and go, well, so I read an article about design principles. I'm thinking we do this service, or could we try implementing, I saw this recently that they released the newest version of PHP, could we change this system to PHP eight instead of seven point that makes the developer, it doesn't have a direct output on the work, but it makes him invested. And developers that feel invested in the process, even when you're reviewing their work, they aren't antagonized. They don't feel like just working, they feel some sense of ownership. And that sense of ownership and participation and value is what a developer, is the difference between a developer who when it gets to five pm end of the workday, they put off the emails, don't look for me. I'm done. A developer who feels invested, she tells them, we need to do this soon. do you mind giving me an extra four hours. That fast meeting helps them feel part of the project and they're more willing to give that extra effort.

Because this fellow will most likely be working on many paths throughout the direction of throughout the duration of the project. So, if they don't, if they have an awareness, what leaving in the works, even as they built, let's say, a service or they implement a database call, they're thinking, well, I better do this in a way, knowing that probably next week, I'll need to do this, or the client wants this. So, as I build this particular feature, as I test the login interface, I have to allow for multiuser login, because I remember the user mentioned in the first meeting, this is what the client wants.  So that's overall understanding of what the system does, it gives the developer a sort of awareness of the long-term direction. When developers work, if you don't involve them in that process, which we've done before, and then you just give them work. This week, do this this week, this week do this.

Yes, you can have a team sharing one roof, they have frequent meals together, they thinking of doing this, they go that, but I find that Scrum in my experience and how it's helped us as a company is you don't have to, I know that's a bit controversial. Yeah, it's controversial because you're telling the developers to not focus on building a wholesome system. But in a way, they're like, you don't really think of every single instance, if an instance comes to mind because you want the workplace to be collaborative, you're able to ask a question, but don't really focus on everything at once. Build your system, if you don't catch something it is okay. Built to the best of your quality in this particular thing. So that when we have the meeting on Friday, and you're able to focus and give it your all, we can now have this situation of all I'm thinking, this can do this, we should have done this, this is a better experience. What Scrum does is, for me now I'll go back to this one point, it isolates the focus point for a developer. Think about this and implement this. Anything else that arises, is handled, is mitigated during the review. As opposed to having a developer think about this and this and this. I also need to think about this and this and this. No. We have a session for working and focusing on technical expertise, because the coding period is a period of technical expertise. Then when we come back to the Scrum meeting, when we are reviewing the code, in that season is when now we can now talk, I'm also thinking you can do this, I'm also thinking you can do this. Focus on your work, do the best you can with what you are aware of.

I mean, of course, if I have a good team, I want to help my team members and so on. But it also goes the other way, if I, if I'm in a team of peers, and I deliver something that has way too many defects compared to the others, it reflects poorly on me in the eyes of my peers. Because I think the powerful thing of this self-governing teams is that you are in the typical sort of, let's call it industrial software development setup. I'm responsible to my manager. And if I screw up, my manager comes to me. That's always the classic way, right, but if you have the self-governance team, and the manifest, just say, build this, and figure out how to do it, then I feel professionally, I have much more skin in the game, because suddenly, it's much more transparent what I'm doing, and it's transparent to my colleagues and teammates as well what I'm doing. So, it gets harder to sort of hide behind and make excuses for bad performance as well, in this case. It quickly becomes more apparent if people in the team aren't pulling their weight, say or if they're doing subpar work. And you can I mean, some people, you can say, okay, you need to improve this.

Should we take the tasks off, do you need training, and so on. So, you also have the opportunity to help people because it's, suddenly it's also in my interest that my colleague gets better. Because his performance also reflects on the product that I delivered. So, I think that it goes both ways.

And if at the moment I'm doing internal developments, so we're developing an application for internal use. It's easier to get hold of the end user. I've been working other places where we are doing product development, and that means that you're typically talking to a sales type, who is supposed to know what the customer wants, but isn't the actual customer and that's harder. It's because they have to make guesses on behalf of customer feedback. So, it's my experience is that the feedback impact on quality and on features is greater when you have access to the actual customer rather than someone who is simply the actual user, compared to someone who is the just the owner of the product. I think that's, that's very helpful if you can get access to the actual user and get quick feedback, loops, quick feedback cycles. So that definitely helps the product quality, because they also, always find something that you're rarely the main expert in whatever the application is supposed to be doing. If you're working on the same thing over many years, you may become one and get the sense of what the user needs. But typically, you need to have an actual user who has domain knowledge to point out the things you missed, which is also easier to do the sooner you get the feedback. This feedback helps to improve quality, errors are identified sooner then corrected. And then I also think this is interesting.

Also, pair programming can be helpful, but that's I think it's not, it's not so much quality, it's mostly for, it mostly helps developing speed and velocity of a feature development.

I mean, there's lots of other stuff I usually do to improve code quality, but that's not Scrum specific. It's stuff like static analysis and lenses and culture, code standards and stuff like that.\"",

With humans, and like, you see, are you familiar with the rat experiment where they had like a dopamine button for the rat, and the rat kept pressing it, pressing it and pressing it to get the dopamine high? Yeah. Yeah. So, humans are different, but not entirely dissimilar from that. And I think it boils back down to like, the goals and tasks element where it's sort of like, Scrum provides you with that structure of like, here's a ticket, solve the ticket tickets done. And because, you know, you've got that visible achievement sense. Because you know, the ticket goes from to do to done. It's like taking a box on, like your own to do list. And that is satisfying, because it's, it's progress, you can, like, it's measurable, you can go well, actually, I sold 20 tickets this week. Like, yeah, that's pretty good. I'm happy with that. And, you know, it's just sort of like, that breeds the motivation, because then you're sort of like, Oh, well, I can turn this into a bit of a game now, like, Can I do twenty-one tickets this week. Now, there is also the pitfall of getting obsessed with that sort of thing, and then beating yourself up personally for not doing enough tickets. But you know, if you're working in a very positive environment, that's encouraging and supportive, then you don't make it about like, how many tickets you could do, but just sort of like just challenge people to do ever so slightly better and stuff. But we're moving into the realms of like psychology and gamification of work, which honestly, has, has a lot to say basically on, like, code, because code quality literally boils down to, are your developers happy? And are they going to put a lot of effort in because they are happy? And if they're not happy? They're almost certainly not going to put the effort in?

And, you know, we would just have like, a completely open and candid conversation about like, maybe like, our tech choices, or perhaps one member of our team was really struggling with learning to code. And, you know, I would come and say, like, person x is having a really terrible time with this, and they can't coach it, you know, we need to do something about that, because they're not getting the support that they need.

That allowed us to make sure that our code was like producing the correct results, it wasn't throwing errors in all the wrong places and stuff like that. I think we also had more time to develop at that point, because we didn't have to get involved with the customer side of things. This later changed, because of just how things worked out. But, you know, our time was basically spent focusing on making the code, changing the code, fixing the code. I think we mostly, we didn't do very good on architecture, because at that time, we didn't really have the skill set for architecture. Since then, I've really heavily got into architecture for software. And I think, again, Agile ties in really neatly with software architecture, because you know, if you are following the whole, sort of like epics, features, stories and tasks element, you can actually map that whole sort of frame to your architecture. And once you've mapped that, you know, it cross references by like story ID, and like, epic ID and feature ID and things like that.

So, because we discussed so often in the ceremonies, so they mostly base and we have the one set that is retrospective. So, if we work on our own. Let me think of an example. We had some very obsolete code. We had an obsolete code for reading it was called the rules. These rules would watch for data coming In. And if something happened that match the rule, it would execute some other code. The logic was very complex, extremely complex and it was slow. Our story was to improve the performance, which was a headache. And in this, we had a huge problem, because it was always expanding the scope. Always. Luckily, because of the daily meetings, we could stay a bit easier on top of it. We were multiple people working on it. And each of us had always new tasks, added new problems that arise. And we had the usually fifteen minutes, morning meetings during the day but it could expand into a full hour. And this helped us a lot because we had the set time where you could discuss all these problems and what the entire one day entailed. Why did this help us? Because we could talk as a team to see how we want to handle it. And we would know what future problems it might pose for us. So, we could account for it in time, if we didn't have these meetings, then we will wait for it to become an issue, it would have a much bigger impact on our code as a whole. So even if daily’s do not have a direct impact on the quality, they help a lot in again, seeing repeat offenders and discussing things. You discuss things as they come as they go, because you the daily meetings happen at a very short interval of time, let's say it's eight hours. So, there are a lot of issues that can come together in that amount of time. So, it's a lot easier to see problems that appear. It if anything comes up, you will easily see in the time of the meeting. So, from a quarter of an hour, which everybody said what they did and what they will do, it will extend, I had this issue, he had that issue, we had that issue. And it's easy to identify and resolve. Very easy. And again, all the issues at the end of the run. It's in their account in time that is used for bug fixing and documentation. That's what usually sacrificed, that's the quality I'm referring to, always. And as an extension to testing, quality also, the code might be a little bit worse, because it was not tested properly, and might have bugs that escape.

And a lot of projects try to save resources on reducing testing. They usually say the developer will handle everything from planning, implementation, testing, building, launching and releasing everything. One man team army, which is very bad. It comes back to Agile when human resources are allocated to require the lack of resources, and then I read this is very bad from my perspective, because you cannot in this industry do everything. Very simple areas require your multiple years of experience, and you cannot keep in your head, database testing, implementation, environments. Impossible. Whoever expects you this has no experience in project planning. The project is probably going to fail. A large project or if it’s a small project, it's probably can be rewritten multiple times. Code quality, also Scrum. So having multiple types of teams in Scrum helps you with the testing. We do have multiple teams, like a team that focuses on people actually look at you, your mental state, try to help you improve your mental state. The actual implementation team, the tester team, the team managers, so it's a much clear separation between roles. I think Scrum helps in this regard the code quality because it helps you focus on your specific code in large projects. In small projects, another story.\"",

It's one of the problems that we had early on with a job was that the product owner was sort of planning everything and everything everybody else was sort of subservient to what the product owner had planned without being able to appraise issues as they found them. So, for example, a developer would be working through cash flow calculations or accounting calculations for some particular loan or bond structure and working out effective rates or something like that. And they would find that find a bug in the current version was causing ridiculous results. Because that wasn't on the current trajectory of planning by the PO, they couldn't actually raise it. Nobody would listen to them. So, they just had to sit there knowing there's a bug. And it was at the point where the unit tests were being developed to confirm the bug was correct. Even though rather than trying to fix the bug and write proper unit test to ensure the system work, they'd be writing unit tests, knowing the bug was there and having to pass an incorrect unit test. And that's what ends up happening in that process. To being able to easily raise issues as you find them and get them into the development cycle, as well as clients finding issues and telling you about them, it helps makes the whole system a lot better, very fast.

A lot of times and when I say a lot of times, I think it's more than eighty percent of the instances, where the QA have challenged the scope in a way where the scope had to change, and they had to adjust it. So that means that you kind of detected the fault very early before that happened, and therefore lowering down your cost of quality, and therefore improving the quality of the product ... So yes, it does. It does help in bringing that and when you do the test planning earlier when a developer is kind of working on the user story and he does see a test script ready with it. And then he's coding it, he knows what he needs to prevent. So, the test plan is right there and therefore it also kind of impacts the end and outcomes. So yeah, I think I think I would agree with your notion that it does impact and it does bring about a change in contrast to the traditional practices. \"",

So, this way, people learn from each other. So, when I had a senior programmer, I assigned a junior one to that programmer and they learned from each other. And this is actually part of like the continuous improvement and learning. Developers learn from each other’s how to write better code. So, this improves the quality of the software by applying those techniques there and learning from each other’s. Another one is let's say we apply these...actually we are using GitHub. And with the practice of GitHub, when we assigned a task to a developer, we request him after he's done programming and write the unit test for the work he has done. He sends a Pull Request. And another team member, and most of the time it's the project leader or a more senior one, reviews the code and provide feedback; developers learn from it. It's not just the unit test that's running. He reviews the code. And if it's correct, then he approves it. And this allows that feature to be included in the software. And the person who is responsible for the quality, the quality assurance engineer or tester actually tests and provides feedback.\"",

The developer only is concerned about the tasks assigned to him. And when he's done, he sends a pull request. After he sends the pull requests, he's done. The next step is the responsibility of the project manager. He reviews the code. And if there is a problem, actually, he sends it back. So, what happens is we are following, let's say, instead of publishing, whatever the developer has done, we have a check mechanism. So, it's a quality assurance that's done during development.

Now if the development team worked as one team, not like individuals, because what I have experienced actually doing my roles in the industry, is like sometimes people actually argue. They actually blame the other one because of those tasks. But with agile development process because you need to have regular meetings and within those meetings you discuss what kind of problems you have. And this actually allows the other team to contribute to help you. So, you can collaborate. And it's not just one person owning the task or the feature, the team owns it.

And to have in mind what can go wrong and pay attention to things and to be aware that they need to finish something and leave time for a person from QA to finish their work.

So, once we had to deliver a project after opening the sprint, we have this audit committee, which is going to go and check from the development perspective that the code is of quality or not. So, it's really from the business perspective if all the requirements have been drafted in a proper format or BRDs or not. Similarly, we have these audits in place, which helps us finding the gaps and improving it from next set of deliveries.

So, the more number of bugs that have come in, the higher the chances it will take more amount of time to fix them, which makes it difficult for the timelines to be met for the delivery. And it impacts the overall lifecycle. So, the good thing is, if you involve QA early you can predict a lot of things that needs to be tested. So, the pressure on the QA team gets reduced from getting involved at the end to being involved in the overall lifecycle is that they can focus more on the other side and functional requirements at the end rather than just focusing on the bugs.\"",

So, every track has different teams where you have an engineering team, there's a product team, so now the scrum master has certain guidelines they're supposed to follow for every project. So, whenever a sprint gets completed for example, there's a project plan need to be created by a scrum master. Then stand-ups need to be conducted. So, all these things, which are in the guidelines of any project to be completed, you have different teams who go back and check that. So, is there sufficient documentation or not? If there's sufficient documentation, are the guidelines being followed or not? If the guidelines are being followed, to what extent have they been followed or not? Similarly, when it comes to product, the product owner has to create the product requirement document. Are all the flaws supposed to be covered - are they covered in the BRD or not?

Quality in terms of planning, quality in terms of delivery, quality in terms of testing and quality in terms of the overall outcome of the project that you have anticipated when you created a business requirement document. So, every team defines those quality parameters initially. That's one thing. OK. Second thing is when you create those audits for these things, for example, then the development team is writing the code, it needs to have comments in it. That's basic hygiene for a development team. So, are they writing quality code or not, which can be understood by someone else. Is that a sufficient amount of unit testing that's being done by the development team or not?
