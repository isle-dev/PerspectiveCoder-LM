But this is what I mean is sort of like that is one of the key things that I'd consider to be quality and like technical debt, you know, it's it ties in with the memory management as well, where it's sort of like, people sort of say, like, Oh, it's only microseconds, it's only microseconds and all that sort of thing. And I'm like, Yes, it is only microseconds. But that's on, like, when we're talking about like one part of the program. And it's actually like, if you look at the actual statistics for like bigger applications, all of those microseconds on like, the, like, you've got ten thousand lines of code, and you've got each line of code consuming twenty microseconds more than it should do. And that adds up. And I was like, even that, in itself is a form of technical debt in my eyes. But you know, like, I can have this argument for days about why you should use certain bits of programming for certain things and other bits for other elements is what it's why I'm such a big fan of Rust. Because it basically is the best of all worlds. Like, it's just a very well-designed language. And I get along with it quite well. And yeah. What was the other one?

And once the code was moved to the Git repository, we will be creating a cross review, where we'll be adding some SMEs and our team leads and other peers just to review the code so that we are not missing, like, we are not missing any standards. So, what I mean standard is there are some things let's, in a technical way, what I can say is, instead of not making the code structured way, like let's say, if I'm having a complete, like I belongs to Java background. So, I can say like, if my Java page is having too many debugging statements, like, sys out and system that print, and many, many things like that, so it doesn't look great, although you're debugging, your writing for that for that debugging purpose, you have to remove that when moving into the code review, because that's the thing that's going to move to production later. So, this way, like whether we have all these method names, and variable names, everything is in proper things. So, these things will be reviewed by other peers. And sometimes even other teams.

I've seen projects were, like, healthcare projects where quality, absolutely zero chance of an error. And you might think, yeah, it's, let's do a test case and provide a hundred percent reliability, but it might not be that, for example, for Google search engine. They have so many computers that the CPU has a very, very small error rate, like, I don't know zero point zero zero zero one percent. But when you have millions of computers processing data, you already have to think about cross checking results. So, you might need the same calculations more than once or more than one PC. And cross check the results. So, this is good quality for them to provide reliable results, not just that your code is good, including the underlying hardware will provide good results. Until this day, NASA, in their mathematical CPUs, they need special hardware to ensure that very high precision, math will provide accurate results, not like oops, there was a zero zero one percent chance for an error and then crashed, you cannot afford this quality results from the project. Quality on long term projects might also mean that you are able to handover your part of the project to someone else in a clean manner. So, the code is commented, the code is beautiful, I would say, this might mean for them quality code. Because if they keep bringing on new programmers, and there's no quality code, after a while the project will crash from start from zero. Code quality might mean testing friendly code. So many cases you expect your code to behave in a certain manner. And why behave many situations. But for maybe even Google, if you want to provide a quality project, you are able, this is why I like functional programming. You can test every part, you have a very good code coverage for retesting, because you know you can test all the inputs for a simple function, and you have certain output ranges. Now if you are coding object oriented and your object can do absolutely everything. That is almost impossible to do code coverage and reliable testing. So might not be quality code for them. Simply because it's unpredictable. What else could mean good quality. Quality code from a UI perspective. We can talk a lot about it. Is it usability?
