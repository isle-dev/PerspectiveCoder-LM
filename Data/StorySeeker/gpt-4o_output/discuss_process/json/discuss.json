My educational background emphasizes analytical thinking, but it may also cause me to overlook nuanced social dynamics tied to narrative perceptions. Regular Reddit use exposes me to diverse storytelling styles, helping to mitigate this potential bias. However, my engineering perspective might predispose me to view social interactions mechanistically. My focus on crowd workers' descriptive perceptions is shaped by an inclination towards understanding system dynamics and disparity reflections in narratives. Recognizing my biases allows me to approach my research questions with greater empathy and rigor.",
